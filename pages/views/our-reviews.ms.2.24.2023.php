                                        I used Closets To Go when I lived in Portland. We moved recently so I used their online service. Our designer was great with working with our very custom needs. She redid the design a few times, after asking a lot of questions, that I hadn’t thought of. We have a coffee bar and wine frig in our closet so she designed for those areas and it all turned out so well. I couldn’t be happier.

                                        My wife wanted to go with a local full service. She thought I would order the system and then let it sit. I kind of wanted to try to do this myself. I was very pleased with the whole process. The packaging was extremely sturdy, but somehow we did receive one broken piece. Closets To Go shipped out the replacement piece the same day we called. The installation went way better than I expected. Highly recommend.

                                        Good job by everyone. Our designer did a great job. I had some questions while installing and once I understood about the corner shelves I was on my way. The install went well and we are pleased.

                                        Overall the process was good. I measured wrong and so the last unit on one of the walls didn’t fit. CTG was great and sent replacement shelves, but only charged me for the shipping. I am not very good at this sort of thing, so I think it took me a little longer than average, but I still finished in a few hours.

                                        I am not complaining about the closet, but there was some miscommunication and so we had some initial problems. They did get resolved quickly.

                                        I understand the need to package everything well for shipping, but I think we could have filled a large dumpster with cardboard. Overall the process went well. I would buy from you again.

                                        We had a bad experience with the delivery. I know that CTG can’t control this, but it put a bad taste in my mouth. There was some breakage. I was afraid I was going to have to wait for a claim to go through, but CTG sent out the parts right away. The closet turned out great, so I hope they change shippers.

                                        I wish the instructions had less pages, so that it would be easy to get through. I didn’t pay enough attention due to the multitude of pages and forgot a step in the installation process. Because of this the system came crashing down. A couple of pieces broke. You guys were great though and only charged me for the shipping.

                                        We didn’t actually purchase a closet recently, but bought parts. We purchased our closet a few years ago, but since retirement have different needs. It was great to be able to switch out some taller hanging for rods on top and bottom. We were also able to add some drawers.

                                        I am an engineer, so you can imagine I am a little picky. I was very impressed with your system. The hanging bracket is genius. I also appreciate the hardware already being installed. I was a little concerned about buying a system online, but Pam, our designer, explained everything ahead of time and assured me that it would fit well and look great. She was correct. I would highly recommend you.

                                        I requested designs from 3 companies and Closets To Go was the only one who paid attention to all of my notes and designed something that would work for me. I am very happy with the result and will buy more closets.

                                        I could write a book, but will keep it short. I forgot to tell CTG about an obstruction in the closet and when I went to install of course ran into problems. I was embarrassed to tell them, but they were great about it. They sent out the new parts, but then there was breakage. So lots of delays, but I got it done.

                                        My neighbor used Closets To Go and told me how easy the installation was, so I thought I would give it a try. I just had a small closet in my home office, but the wall was bowed. I wasn’t sure the last side was going to work without having to shim off the bottom. Thanks to the Camar hanging bracket you use, I was able to adjust the hanging bracket and everything fit great. I do not like doing these types of projects, but this went very smooth.

                                        I needed to save some money, so I decided to do this myself. I was sort of dreading the ordeal, but my wife had been after me for a long time to get this done. After looking at a few online closet companies, I chose Closets To Go, due to their hanging bracket. I definitely chose the right company. With the hanging bracket, and having all of the hardware pre-installed, it was very easy. We now have a beautiful walk in closet and my wife is very happy.

                                        This is a great product and was easy to install. I did this myself as my husband was out of town. I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to do it, but found once I got the rail installed, the rest was pretty easy. It was a reach in closet for my baby and it only took me a couple of hours.

The first closet I did with them was a little bit of a learning curve, as I had not done anything like that before. Always an easy transaction.

                                        The first closet was a learning curve. I am glad I started with the smallest one. It made the other closets easier to install. The instructions were kind of confusing as they are long, but I only had to use a few of the pages. Would prefer instructions that are just for my design. Overall though it went well.

                                        We had some issues with the drawer fronts having the wrong holes for our handles. Due to this we had to wait quite awhile as we had raised panels. So that was kind of frustrating. The closet turned out nice though.

                                        We are very happy with the closet systems from Closets To Go. We ordered five reach-in closet systems, and they arrived in meticulously packed boxes after about 5 days. What drew me to Closets To Go was the ease of installation. I did not want to spend time assembling drawers, figuring out which sides the screws went on, or which pieces went where, or cutting pieces to non-standard widths. Basically Closets To Go did all the work they possibly could before shipping the closets to us. In the end, the biggest closet (about 10 feet long) took us about 5 hours of installation, while medium closets (about 5 feet) took us about 3 hours. I am also impressed with the quality of the product. The pieces of the system seem to be very strong. This includes the wood, the metal rods, and the drawers. The couple of snags we had were dealt with promptly by their great Customer Service Department. We were missing a couple of pieces, and another pieced (a drawer railing) was broken. All of these pieces were sent out immediately and arrived within 2 days. I have enthusiastically recommended Closets To Go to friends and relatives, and will continue to promote their wonderful product.

                                        We have really enjoyed our 'closets to go' system. Although it took a bit longer to install than we were expecting, it is well worth it. The ease of the website use and flexibility of design were both very important factors in our purchase. Our closet was so easy to organize after installation and months later it is still just as neat. Overall very happy with purchase

Thank-you for giving us a beautiful closet.

                                        This is the second time I've worked with Pam Wells to build the inside of our closets. She had great ideas and was able to quickly get us our design and replacement parts. I screwed up one of the original measurements by writing 80" rather than 90" and she was able to get me the corrected order within the day. I will, of course, use Closetstogo.com again if I need to build out another closet in the future. Erik

The sales rep was more than helpful and worked with me to adjust the dimensions to my liking. The order arrived in tact and was fairly simple to install. If I had any more closets I would order from them again.

I had been out of town taking care of my mother and when I came back there was a beautiful closet for me. The designer must have asked all of the right questions, as there was a place for everything. Now my husband wants to do his closet.
